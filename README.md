# Cryptography
this will feature various toy cases of crypto-protocols (either in python or C/C++) starting with Elliptic curve based key exchange and building towards ZK protocols first Groth16 and then Plonk. We will also add some mathematical background, especially about estimating number of points on an elliptic curve, since this is crucial, though in practice one works with fixed elliptic curves. We will also talk about elliptic curve pairings which are used to generate CRS in Groth16.
